# 🔐 Security Overview – Ethical E-Commerce Platform

This document summarizes the security design, implementations, and testing of the platform across multiple domains of cybersecurity, including:

- Application Security (AppSec)
- DevSecOps
- API Security
- Container Hardening
- Cloud Security Awareness
- Offensive Security (Self-assessment)

The goal is to demonstrate not only basic protections, but also a security mindset and forward-looking awareness in key areas.

---

## ✅ Implemented Security (MVP Scope)

### 🔸 Application Security (AppSec)
- **Input validation**: All inputs are parsed and validated at handler level (Go, Node).
- **Password hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before storage.
- **JWT authentication**: Auth service issues expiring signed JWT (HS256).
- **Role-based access (RBAC)**: Admin/customer scopes enforced in API.
- **CORS**: Enabled with restricted origin settings.
- **Parameterized queries**: All DB access uses prepared statements (pgx, Mongoose).

### 🔸 DevSecOps
- **Secrets managed via `.env` + `.gitignore`**
- **GitHub Actions Secrets** used for deployment environments
- **Dependency scanning** (manual): `npm audit`, `go list -m -u`
- **Static analysis planned**: `gosec`, ESLint (to be added to CI)
- **CI/CD pipelines** exclude all secrets and test for code safety

## 🧪 Offensive Testing Summary (Self-Pentest)

Basic self-attacks were simulated to validate common vulnerability classes:

| Attack Type    | Result       | Status   | Fix Applied                     |
|----------------|--------------|----------|----------------------------------|
| SQL Injection  | Not possible | ✅ Safe   | Param queries used everywhere    |
| XSS (input fields) | Blocked   | ✅ Safe   | Frontend escapes + no injection |
| JWT Tampering  | Detected     | ✅ Fixed  | Signature always verified        |
| CSRF (form post) | Not tested | ⚠ Planned | Token-based defense TBD          |
| Broken Auth    | Denied       | ✅ Fixed  | RBAC + JWT + route guards        |

---

## 🔐 API Security

- All APIs protected by JWT + RBAC
- Admin endpoints separated and protected
- Planned:  
  - Rate limiting at gateway level  
  - IP allowlist for admin dashboard  
  - Swagger doc validation against schema

## 📦 Container Hardening

| Feature                 | Status     |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Use of minimal base images (`alpine`) | ✅ Done |
| No root user inside containers         | ⚠ Planned |
| Healthcheck in Dockerfile             | ✅ Basic |
| Trivy or Dockle scan                  | ⚠ Planned |
| Volumes with controlled access        | ✅ Basic in dev environment |

---

## ☁️ Cloud Security Awareness

Though this is a demo project, basic awareness and setup has been implemented:

- **Hosted DB** (Mongo Atlas, Railway PostgreSQL) restricted to whitelisted IPs  
- **All secrets managed in GitHub Actions / dashboard env**  
- **No hardcoded credentials**  
- (Planned) Use of **custom domains + TLS** if deployed to production

| A06: Vulnerable Components        | ✅ Manual   | Audit tools used manually     |
| A07: Identification Failures      | ✅          | Role-checks implemented       |
| A08: Integrity Failures           | ❌ Skipped | No code/image signing yet     |
| A09: Logging & Monitoring         | ⚠ Planned  | Prometheus + log alerts planned |
| A10: SSRF                         | ✅ N/A      | No relevant use cases         |

## 🚧 Future Improvements

| Area           | Planned Work                        |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| DevSecOps      | Add static scans (`gosec`, ESLint)  |
| CI/CD          | Add GitHub Action test + Trivy scan |
| AppSec         | Add CSRF defense                    |
| Monitoring     | Use Prometheus + alertmanager       |
| Logging        | Add ELK stack for log tracing       |
| API            | Add gateway-level rate limiting     |

## 📌 Summary

This project is designed and built with **security-in-mind**, not only as a feature but as a foundation.  
While some protections are implemented, others are documented for future or production use.
